Creates shortcodes that will generate an unordered list of your WordPress links (bookmarks).

== Description ==

Creates three shortcodes ([bookmarks], [links] and [blogroll]) that will generate an unordered list of your WordPress links.
Preforms the same function as `wp_list_bookmarks()`.

You can any of the shortcodes within a post, page, media, text widget, etc.
This makes it much more flexible then using the default Links page template that may be included in your theme as you can add other content surrounding the list, also when you change themes there is no need to edit the page.

You can customize the output of the list by using the same arguments that are accepted by the [wp_list_bookmarks()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_list_bookmarks) function.
Example: `[bookmarks show_images=0 show_ratings=1 show_name=1 ]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My theme includes a links page template. Why do I need this plugin? =
This plugin is more flexible then the Links page template. You can use any of the three shortcodes within a post, page, text widget, media, etc. You can also add other content surrounding the list, also when you change themes there is no need to edit the page.

= Can I use the shortcodes in text widgets? =
If you wish to use these shortcodes in the sidebar text widgets, add this code to a site-specific plugin or as a [code snippet](https://github.com/bungeshea/code-snippets):

    add_filter( 'widget_text', 'shortcode_unautop' );
    add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' );

Keep in mind that doing this will allow you to use **all** shortcodes in text widgets, not only the ones added by this plugin
